# CS50's Mobile App Development with React Native - Project Submissions

This repository will have all of my projects submissions for CS50's Mobile App
Development with React Native (through Harvard). New folders will be added to
the repository as I complete projects throughout the class. Each individual
project will have a README detailing the project requirements as well.
